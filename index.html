                            <strong>Professional & Ethical Behaviour: Personal Organization/Time Management</strong><br>
                            I aimed to enhance my time management skills to maintain a balance between work, rest, and personal life while also improving the quality of work I deliver by using planning strategies.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>How will these tasks benefit my next work experience?</strong><br>
                            Learning to balance tasks, rest, and personal activities helps ensure productivity and reduces burnout in future roles.

                            <strong>Literacy: Technological Literacy</strong><br>
                            I wanted to strengthen my proficiency in Next.js, Node.js and PHP to contribute effectively to projects and improve my overall programming skills.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>How will these tasks benefit my next work experience?</strong><br>
                            By focusing on Node.js and Next.js, I improved my ability to write efficient code, debug effectively, and build scalable server-side applications.

                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <strong>Critical & Creative Thinking: Inquiry & Analysis</strong><br>
                            My goal was to ask more precise questions and fully understand tasks before starting them to reduce errors and work more efficiently.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>How will these tasks benefit my next work experience?</strong><br>
                            Asking clear and concise questions improved my ability to execute tasks accurately and collaborate better in team environments.

                <p class="mt-3">Reflections:<br><br>I successfully organized my time by creating daily schedules, setting reminders, and maintaining a consistent work-rest routine, allowing me to stay productive. Additionally, I became more confident my ability to write cleaner and more efficient backend solutions, which earned positive feedback on my contributions. I also enhanced my task analysis skills by asking the right questions to reduce confusion, ensuring alignment with project deliverables and improving overall efficiency.<br><br>Although I improved my Node.js skills and became more confident in writing efficient backend solutions, I didn't reach the advanced level of expertise I had hoped for in PHP. This was partly because of time limitations and the steep learning curve of some advanced concepts. I had to work with Laravel libraries, which I had never used before. While I managed to get by and complete my tasks, I feel that with more time, I could have explored Laravel in greater depth and gained a stronger understanding of its features and best practices, rather than just learning enough to get the job done.</p>
